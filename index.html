        <p>Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight. In that spirit we dwcided to register Vukanji as a company to deal with 
            organic products to help our customers deal with issues that affect them in lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the 
           food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic Canada, and Australia). Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial food additives, and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as chemical ripening, food irradiation, and genetically modified ingredients</p>
